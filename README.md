This Python code aims to build a movie recommendation system using movie metadata and credits data. It processes and merges two datasets (tmdb_5000_movies.csv and tmdb_5000_credits.csv), extracts key features such as tags, genres, keywords, cast, crew, and taglines, and prepares the data for building a recommendation model.

# Key Steps in the Code:
Data Loading:

The movie and credits datasets are loaded into data frames, and the structure of the data is examined.
Top 5 Popular Movies:

The top 5 most popular movies based on the "popularity" column are selected, and their posters are fetched using The Movie Database (TMDB) API.
Data Merging:

The two datasets (dfmovies and dfcredits) are merged on the title column to create a combined dataset with all necessary information.
Missing Values Handling:

Missing values in the dataset are handled by filling NaN values in the tagline column and dropping other rows with missing data.
Feature Engineering:

The overview column is split into tags, and additional features like genres, keywords, cast, and crew are processed into a single list of tags for each movie.
The names of actors (up to 5) are extracted from the cast column and added to the tags.
The director's name is extracted from the crew column and added to the tags.
The title, original_title, and tagline are also transformed into lists of words and added to the tags.
Tag Transformation:

The tags are converted into lowercase and concatenated into a single string for each movie.
Final Dataset:

A new dataframe is created with the movie ID, title, and tags, which will be used for building the recommendation model.


Data Preprocessing:

Stemming: The tags are processed using stemming (PorterStemmer) to reduce words to their root form (e.g., "action" becomes "act").
Stop-word Removal: Unnecessary words like "the" and "and" are removed using the CountVectorizer with stopwords set to 'english'.
Vectorization:

The tags for each movie are vectorized using CountVectorizer to transform the text data into numerical vectors for easier comparison.
Similarity Calculation:

Cosine Similarity: The code calculates the cosine similarity between the movie vectors, which helps determine how similar movies are to each other.
Movie Recommendations:

Top Movie Recommendations: The function recommend_movies_names returns the most similar movies based on the cosine similarity score.
Poster Fetching: The movie poster images for recommended movies are fetched using the TMDB API.
Displaying Recommendations:

A list of recommended movie names and their corresponding posters is displayed using HTML and images to give a graphical representation of the recommendations.



# Applications:
This dataset can be used for building a movie recommender system, where movies are recommended based on the similarity of their tags. This system can suggest movies similar to a given movie by comparing the tags derived from various attributes like genre, keywords, cast, and crew.


Content-Based Filtering: This system recommends movies based on content similarity (tags, genres, etc.).
Movie Discovery: Users can input a movie name, and the system will display similar movies, helping users discover related content.
This recommendation system provides a way to suggest movies based on their metadata and can be enhanced further with more advanced models or algorithms for better personalization.
